# Utilities
Random helpful scripts.

## Prefix
This script will rename files that begin with the first prefix substituting for the second.

    $ ./prefix.sh "old_prefix" "new_prefix"

## Re7z
This script renames all of the files in the directory stripping out the 7z part. Obviously, it should only be run on a directory that contains split 7zip files.

    $ ./re7z.sh
